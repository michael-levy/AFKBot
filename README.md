## Word Game

Find a word with a given syllable, and get points based on it's rarity!

``.setup`` to begin a game.

``.join`` to add yourself.

``.start`` to begin

When the bot gives you a syllable, provide an unusual word that contains it! It will give you a ten second timer, so don't take too long!

Points are given based on the [Oxford frequency bands](https://public.oed.com/how-to-use-the-oed/key-to-frequency/). The frequencies are taken from [Google Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams#) and the syllables from [this](http://www.delphiforfun.org/programs/Syllables.htm) person's list. 

## Misc Functions

### AFK

Replaces the defunct AFK function of NotSoBot.

Send ``.afk [message]`` to set your AFK. 

When someone pings you, that message will be sent.

If you send a message, your AFK will be erased. 

### Anti-Dad jokes

Fight back against dad jokes by responding 'NO' to the phrase 'I'm dad'.

### Words

``.freq [word]`` to get percentage of use (from 2009-2019 NGram).

``.freqm [word]`` as above, but uses per million words.
